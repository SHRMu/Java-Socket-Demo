# Java-Socket-Demo

we assume this is a very interesting chatting room game and 
every new connected client(without register) can only ask 10 questions for free.
The server will every time pick up one question in the shared linked list to answer.
Answered question will be removed from the linked list, 
and also answer will be push to all clients in this chatting room.

####To start this program:

+ run Server main Func
+ run Client main Func
